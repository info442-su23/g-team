### Mission Statement:
Our team aims to assist and enhance the safety of University of Washington students with an app that is accessible and community-based.


### Problem Statement:

Violent crimes in Seattle have arisen in recent years, especially in the most populated areas of the city including University District, Capitol Hill, Pioneer Square, and the International District (Ramirez, 2023). In October 2022, there were many incidents that affected UW students, including four students injured from a shooting, and a pedestrian being struck by a vehicle because of a failed drive-by shooting. This has led many residents and students to express concern about their safety (Renn, 2023). Unfortunately, current solutions and alerts of crimes are not transparent or quick enough. For UW students, alerts of incidents are sent way later than the time that the crime occurred. Additionally, other crime apps require subscriptions to access some features, and these apps do not specifically tailor to the UW community or UW students. The University of Washington currently stands as the third university with the highest total number of incidents in the nation (Pyun, 2020).

As current UW students concerned about the safety of ourselves and our peers, we propose a solution of an application available for all UW students. Our solution seeks to provide a community and forum where students can alert other peers of suspicious activity or incidents. Our application will alert UW students in a more timely manner, and will allow users to avoid certain areas of U District and the campus more quickly. Students can communicate with others, share information and photos, and look out for one another with our solution.
